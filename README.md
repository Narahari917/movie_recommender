# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommender system based on cosine similarity using the TMDB Movie Metadata dataset from Kaggle. The recommender system suggests movies similar to a given input, providing users with personalized movie recommendations.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle: [TMDB Movie Metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata).

## Features
- Utilizes cosine similarity for measuring movie similarity.
- Implemented a user interface with Streamlit for easy interaction and experimentation.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed. You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Features and Experimentation
- Experiment with different features (genres, keywords, cast, etc.) to enhance the recommendation results.
- Provide feedback on the user interface and explore ways to improve the user experience.
